## About this Project

This project is an application that allows users to find national parks of their choice by inputing preferred activies, topics, and distance radius. A neat list of parks is then rendered when the user clicks on the search button. This project was a passion project of mine. As I explored different national parks, I became more interested in hiking and nature and wanted to develop a tool that could help me find the best places to hike.
